## 🧭 My Work Style

- Calm planning > last-minute chaos  
- Structure > stress  
- Clarity > confusion  
- Sleep > 3AM debugging 😴

---

## ✅ We’ll Get Along If You:

- Respect timelines & communicate 
- Care about building, not just presenting  
- Share the load — not just the credit  

---

## 🚫 Maybe Not a Match If You:

- Ghost or miss deadlines  
- Expect others to carry the project  
- Only show up for submission day
